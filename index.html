        <h2>Art of Pizza</h2>
        <p>This pizza joint is located on northwest side of Chicago
            in a neighborhood called Lakeview. They serve pizza by the
            slice, from thin crust to deep dish (sausage, pepperoni, spinach,
            onion, or mushroom). The slices themselves are very big and robust, so getting one 
            slice will usually hit the spot but sometimes when I felt ravenous I ate two. 
            I rave about their pizza because of their golden 
            brown crust, terrific tomato sauce, and excellent cheese with oregano. I worked in the
            Lakeview area for about ten years and this was definitely a place I ate for lunch and dinner
            alot.

        <h2>La Villa</h2>
        <p>This restaurant is conveniently located a few blocks away from the house where I grew up in the Old Irving
            Park neighborhood. They are a family owned Italian-American restaurant, that serve classic italian
            dishes but are known for their famous pizza. Their thin crust pizza, whether cheese, sausage, or 
            pepperoni is always top notch. What I most remember loving about this pizza is the sauce and cheese
            flavors along with pizza crust. La Villa is definitely a family favorite.

        <h2>Chicago's Pizza</h2>
        <p>This restaurant has been a neighborhood favorite for 25 years. I worked a few blocks away
            from their first location in Lakeview area and could not stop eating their pizza. They have a
            variety of pizza pie options, deep-dish, stuffed, and gluten-free. When it comes to pizza,
            everything they have taste great. My favorite is their pepperoni and spinach thin crust  
            or stuffed slices.

        <div id="pequods">
        <h2>Pequod's Pizza</h2>
        <p>The very best deep dish pizza in my opinion comes from Pequod's. What makes it unique is 
            there hearty sauce on top of a crispy burnt crust with hot cheese. The pizza's take 45 minutes to make
            but are worth the wait. The slices and toppings are huge and absolutely have to be eaten with a knife
            and fork. It has been making great pizza for 25 years in the Lincoln Park neighborhood in Chicago.

        <h2>Pizano's Pizza and Pasta</h2>
        <p>This pizza joint was first introduced to me from my wife. She went to college a few blocks 
            from their Madison street location in the heart of downtown. They serve traditonal Italian style 
            dishes but their thin crust pizza is my favorite. My wife and I enjoy dining in for the friendly
            service and casual atmosphere.

        <h2>Paulie Gee's</h2>
        <p>If your looking for a great atmosphere and great pizza this definitely is the place. They specialize
            in wood-fired pizza pies in the Neapolitan style. They have a wide range of pizza toppings 
            (Prosciutto, Canadian Bacon, Brisket) just to name a few. My wife and I enjoy the open kitchen, 
            so we can see are pizza's being made in the brick ovens. They also have a great selection of craft beers to choose
            from.
